## Project Description:
Pioneerflix is ​​a subscription-based streaming website which will be like Netflix but not exactly Netflix. We have used various features and functionalities in it to make the user experience smooth.

Here the users can easily access the TV channels. So, users can see live TV shows. By clicking on the tv channel icon the live tv show is starting on another page. From there users can access the other tv channels as their demands from see more options.

Log in, sign up system is used for authentication on this site. The user will be registered on the site by signing up. After registration the registered users can get video access. Registered user will log in every time to enter the site if he or she is not logged in the site so that unauthenticated users do not get access to the video.

Users will not be able to see exclusive videos without pay. If any user paid then he can see those videos. So users need to make a subscription here. They can see subscription packages by clicking on the subscribe button from navbar. Users can buy any package as they choose. The stripe payment method gateway system is implemented to get payment from users.

By clicking on the video thumbnail the video is played in the video details page. Here the full video is playing to entertain users. We have used the like, comment, share, add to favorite list and rating features in the video details page. In this, users can like the video and share their opinion about the video in the comments.

We have implemented a dashboard to upload videos and various information as well. We can access our dashboard from our profile in navbar which contains users data. Admin as well as users can upload videos from the dashboard. When the user uploads the video, it will first go to the admin for review. Then the admin can publish or delete the video considering the quality of the video.  Admin can upload and delete as many videos as he wants from manage videos page of the dashboard. The dashboard will contain user information. Users can update their information if they want.
